#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.
class LineAnalyzer

  #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  # Implement the analyze_file() method() to:
  #* Read the 'test.txt' file in lines
  #* Create an array of LineAnalyzers for each line in the file

  # Implement the calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the highest number of occurences of a word across all lines
  #and stores this result in the highest_count_across_lines attribute.
  #* identifies the words that were used with the highest number of occurrences
  #and stores them in print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines.
