#Implement all parts of this assignment within (this) module2_assignment2.rb file

#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.
class LineAnalyzer
  #Implement the following read-only attributes in the LineAnalyzer class.
  #* highest_wf_count - a number with maximum number of occurrences for a single word (calculated)
  #* highest_wf_words - an array of words with the maximum number of occurrences (calculated)
  #* content,         - the string analyzed (provided)
  #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  #Add the following methods in the LineAnalyzer class.
  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #* calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result

  #Implement the initialize() method to:
  #* take in a line of text and line number
  #* initialize the content and line_number attributes
  #* call the calculate_word_frequency() method.

  #Implement the calculate_word_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the maximum number of times a single word appears within
  #  provided content and store that in the highest_wf_count attribute.
  #* identify the words that were used the maximum number of times and
  #  store that in the highest_wf_words attribute.
end

#  Implement a class called Solution.
class Solution

  # Implement the following read-only attributes in the Solution class.
  #* highest_count_across_lines - a number with the value of the highest frequency of a word
  #* highest_count_words_across_lines - an array with the words with the highest frequency

  # Implement the following methods in the Solution class.
  #* analyze_file() - processes 'test.txt' intro an array of LineAnalyzers
  #* calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines which line of
  #text has the highest number of occurrence of a single word
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the words with the
  #highest number of occurrences and their count

  # Implement the analyze_file() method() to:
  #* Read the 'test.txt' file in lines
  #* Create an array of LineAnalyzers for each line in the file

  # Implement the calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the highest number of occurences of a word across all lines
  #and stores this result in the highest_count_across_lines attribute.
  #* identifies the words that were used with the highest number of occurrences
  #and stores them in print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines.

  #Implement the print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() method to
  #* print the result in the following format
